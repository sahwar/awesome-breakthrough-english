Hi Steven,

       I think there are two steps to do:
             Modify the playbook, host_var, inventory_file or role
             Installation and debugging, this steps maybe take more time.
             
Now inventory_file and host_var are also fininshed. 

Eunice and I will  take a leave tommorrow, so next week we will try the first installation.

I will send you email once the first installation is done.

Thanks
