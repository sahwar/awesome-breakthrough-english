Hi all,

Refer to Matthieuâ€™s comment(comments) and feedback(feedbacks) from(during) UX weekly meeting, there are two updates as below("As below" would be used only in print, to indicate something lower on the page. you have to use as follows here)  :

1.	Remove the Usability testing
2.	Clarify to use QA lab only

Attached the updated file, and any comments from you(you can remove 'from you') are welcome, thank you.
