Hi Stephen,
 
The configuration is not available on UX2.x, so this ticket can’t be reproduced by now. 
 
But another issue is（was） found on BT env: if user tap(click) “Report as spam” button and select “Yes” option on confirm window, the selected message(s) will be moved to Trash folder instead of Spam folder.

“Report as spam” feature has not been completed on Copernicus AccessUI 1.2.00x (yet), confirmed with dev. And (I)tested (it) on UX2.3MR1 env, "Mark as spam" button works well (well-worked). 

And communicate (After checked)with dev, fixing this issue need to change more than API, so they need further discussion.

Regards,
Jeanne
