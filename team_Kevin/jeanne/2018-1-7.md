Hi Rohit,
I have(better rm have)replaced the personal cloud jar, and now message with cloud attachment can be sent successfully (now).
When download cloud file:
a.	From Inbox, click the file name, it will jump to cloud page to display (?what?)and the file can be downloaded successfully, also opened well
b.	From Drafts, click(clicking) the file name will download a json file, not the attachment self(rm self)
On Etisalat, there is no preview draft feature, so canâ€™t download draft attachment.
