Hi Mark,

I am writing this letter to inform you of my taking an unexpected leave due to family emergency. I have just gotten word that my mom has to see her doctor this afternoon. 

Could we reschedule the 1-1 meeting for tomorrow? If not, I will have my cell phone ready. Looking forward to hear from you.

Thanks,
Jane
