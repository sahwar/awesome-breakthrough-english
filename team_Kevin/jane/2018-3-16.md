Hi Chris,

Could you please check the code to see if these performance counters were increased. I remmember I should have done that, but not quite sure now. If they were not increased, could you please raise a ticket for this issue? I'll take a look tommorrow.

By the way, can you please make sure if there is a TST page for KAV Anti-Phishing? If not, could you please create one and add some test cases on that?

Thanks,
Jane
