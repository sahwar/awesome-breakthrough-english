Hi Mark,

I think you are so busy that you may forget the 1-1, as I forgot it totally, but got the reminder from calendar. ^-^

And I'm in loopup for 5 minutes, then offline for English class.


(Since my English training will start at XXXX, I have to hang up loopup call. If you want to reschedule, please let me know.)

Regards,
Jane
