We need to use the RnL environment to run the performance tests every day, which needs to uninstall RazorGate and install it and run the tests using merlin, so I'm trying to change the razorgate playbook, but there is some problem when I running the razorgate playbook, I'm not sure the inventory file and host_vars are correct in the admin server 10.48.129.60. 

So it would be appreciated if you can share your production and configuration in merlin.
