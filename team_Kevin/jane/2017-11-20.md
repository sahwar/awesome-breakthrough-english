We need to use the RnL environment to run the performance tests every day, which needs to uninstall RazorGate and install it and run the tests using merlin, so I'm trying to change the razorgate playbook, but there is some problem when I running the razorgate playbook, I'm not sure the inventory file and host_vars are correct in the admin server 10.48.129.60. 

We need to run performance tests on RnL environment every day. These tests include uninstall and install RazorGate, then run them with merlin. However there are some problems with razorgate playbook, I'm not sure whether the inventory file and host_vars are correct on admin server 10.48.129.60.

It will be appreciated if you can share your ??production?? and configuration in merlin.
