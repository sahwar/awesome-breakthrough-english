Hi Luis and Mark,

About MR1 regression and ticket: 
1.	Because Fastweb use RH7 platform, QA didn’t have this environment; we need to kick a fresh install regression run in CFGDB mode. There is an RH7 environment *devioniq.es.cpth.ie* and the nightly (*What is nightly?*) is running RG-58-RH7-CfgDB on razorgate-5.8.043-8.ge7d5696.x86_64.rpm build. Can we kick a RG5.8.043 regression run on this server? (*If so, maybe?*) And we don’t need to setup a new RH7 machine.
2.	Ticket 'RAZORGATE-2667' Logging cid (*What?*) in SmtpClientClose hasn't been merged into RG5.8.043, we need to remove this from the release notes.
3.	From dashboard https://jira.synchronoss.net:8443/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=20458, there is a ticket 'RAZORGATE-2657': Registry settings in config.db should not be case sensitive and it is labeled MR1, would it be better to update the label to MR2?
4.	cptest@good.es.cpth.ie：it seems that this server is IPV6 unavailable, so some script like 'qa/Messaging/RazorGate/policies/comparisons/abuse_test/rbl/ipv6/' fails
    [cptest@good bin]$  tracepath6  devcrown0008.es.cpth.ie
    connect: Network is unreachable
    [cptest@good bin]$
    [cptest@good bin]$ tracepath6 "fd00::105:0:0:31:8"
    connect: Network is unreachable
    (*What is this?*)

    I don’t have ROOT permission to do more actions on this server, any help would be grateful.
 
Thanks
