Hi Team,
A "null" policy namespace "policies-20171012-090936" with no rules and policies is as below:
  [root@devcamaro policies-20171012-090936]# ls
  [root@devcamaro policies-20171012-090936]# pwd
  /home/cyang/install/remote/10_128_17_1/razorgate-HEAD/install/mira/usr/store/policies/policies-20171012-090936
  [root@devcamaro logs]# ls -la  /home/cyang/install/remote/10_128_17_1/razorgate-HEAD/install/mira/usr/store/policies/policies-20171012-090936/default
  ls: cannot access /home/cyang/install/remote/10_128_17_1/razorgate-HEAD/install/mira/usr/store/policies/policies-20171012-090936/default: No such file or directory

But from smtp.log, as below, it shows "default" file under "policies-20171012-090936" which actually doesn't exist:
  20171016 071236518+0100 devcamaro14 smtp 15883 0 140339469268736 Info;SmtpPluginDispatcherMiscPolicyLoaded(2080/2) id=================:policy=/home/cyang/install/remote/10_128_17_1/razorgate-HEAD/install/mira/usr/store/policies/policies-20171012-090936/default

This log is not correct here. Please help to confirm, instead of "Info" do we need to update the log point to "Warn" in order to output the working information for this is null policy namespace;
