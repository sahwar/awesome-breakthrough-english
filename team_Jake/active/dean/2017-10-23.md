Hi Rohit,
 
I have checked again. The content type property is still null.

You can visit http://rwc-hinoki06.owmessaging.com:8080/kiwi-uxdevelop-release/ with dev01@rwc-hinoki05.owmessaging.com/p to check it.
 
You were right about the thumbnail property, but client has to send request to get cloud files again when user opens cloud file manager.

And I think client would display the thumbnail when adding attachment in the near future.

So the thumbnail property is necessary. Would you please reconsider it?



Hi Dean,
 
I have fixed the issue where the content type property was coming as null & also enhanced the file create api to include the thumbnail property.

I have attached the local jar copy of the changes, Would you be able to test it once locally please and then I will do a release.


Thanks Rohit,
 
I downloaded the jar, replaced the jar (webtop-personal-cloud-1.0.8.jar) in my environment with it and restarted tomact.

But it seems not working. The content type is still null and the thumbnail property does not return.

Anything wrong?
