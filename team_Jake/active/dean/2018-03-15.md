As Sean said, If the user wants to zoom in to view more of the text,

then they need to view the transcoded PDF in a PDF viewer and use the zoom functionality there.

Now the default scale used in client is 1.0 (max is 4.0) when view as image.

But when set the scale to 4.0, the content still cannot be read.

Any comments/thoughts on the above?

Hi Sean, 

I viewed the transcoded PDF in a PDF viewer and zoomed in to biggest.

But the content still cannot be seen.

Please look at attachment pdf-to-biggest.png for details.
