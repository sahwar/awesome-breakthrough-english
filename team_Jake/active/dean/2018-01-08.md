Meiwen Hwang,

What do you mean 'The implementation of this ticket is not usable at all on TUI'?

TUI can zoom and shrink. Please see (attachments) 'zoom1.png' and 'zoom2.png' attachments.

Dean,

I understand TUI can zoom, however, we tested on the real device iphone 6 and ipad, the zoom is not working well.

-----------------

The problem Meiwen said is that user cannot read content when previews excel on TUI.

Tested in http://rwc-hinoki06:8080/kiwi-develop-201-rel/index-tui.jsp with linus/p on iphone.

The zoom feature works well. But even zoom in to (into) the largest, user still can not read content.

Get the source url and put it into address (bar) of browser directly.

The source(the attachment named preview-in-address.png from this) is fuzzy.

This is related to MEDIATRANS-6.

Sean, could you help to check it?

Thank you.
