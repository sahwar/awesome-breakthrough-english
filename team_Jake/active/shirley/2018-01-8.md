Could you add a line to explain "Safe sender" (Add this mail sender into safe sender list) option In 'Mail' panel->mail detail->'more' drop down? And also need to add a line to explain the function of radio button "only allow mail from known senders" in 'Settings' panel -> Mail ->Safe senders. 

The document seems to missed the descriptions of two parts marked in red, 'safe sender' button in Mail detail and radio button 'only allow mail from known senders' in Settings.

Are you operating in the mx environment? Try to find a mail from another account (Rather than from self), click the icon button (Marked in red), confirm is the 'safe sender' option show on the menu list.
