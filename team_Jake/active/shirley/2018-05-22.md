The 'Edit' icon  shouldn't be placed in the center. When user upload avatar, the 'Delete' icon will appear on the right, so I think it will be more comfortable to put the 'Edit' icon on the left(please refer to UX2.3 release).

Comparing these two diagrams, I just wanted to know why the text was changed from left-aligned into right-aligned in new UI design, I'm not referring to the location of the checkbox, so I think those checkboxs should be placed on the right side of the text in both Auto-reply and Auto-forward, this is consistent with the past and is consistent with other pages.
