If user does nothing, clicks Cancel, no warning appears, because the form isn't dirty, this is 'worked as designed'.

These two behaviors are different. When user add a new event, input email address, the form has changed. However, by using ‘invite to email’ option, the email address was directly added into compose as default, click Cancel, the form does not change.

Although click the Cancel, compose window will pop up warning for the predefined email id. But we don't think this behavior is necessary and unlikely to pop up warning for cancelling ‘invite to event’ action (cancelling a new event with predefined Attendee email address).
