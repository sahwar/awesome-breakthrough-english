1. The 3 new options should always be displayed and the sender list (Including 'whitelist' and 'blocksender list') should always be enabled no matter what the value of 'Only allow mail from known senders' is.

2. At the last meeting, we made it clear that when user clicks the 'Whitelist sender', we should add the mail sender into allow list in PAB.
I have a question, how do we determine whether the sender had already been added into the allow list? Will the Webtop throw an error?

3. If Webtop can provide a special API to check the existing senders, I think UI will do better.
