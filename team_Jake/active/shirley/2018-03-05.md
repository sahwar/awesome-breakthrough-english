Hi Ivan,

The realization (it is safe and will not cause any problems in the production upgrade) we came out after the discussion was:

-1)  Add a config in custom-config.js.

-2) Add the 'initFn' into LoadPSOConfig.jsp, Because 'DanteNewGH' is only needed by BT.
, It is not recommended to put this method into SDK, if we need, we will get it from this file.

```
initFn: function(){

        DanteNewGH.init({"siteArea":"presales","displayGlobalSearch":"Y","displayCountry":"Y","width":1154,"country":"India"});

    },
 ```


    
-3) overwrite buildItems method of /src/main/sencha/richui/app/view/Main.js class

Thanks & Regards,

Shirley
