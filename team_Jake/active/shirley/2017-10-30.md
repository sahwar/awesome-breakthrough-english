1. There used to be a 'Today' button on the 'Calendar' tool bar but now it is missing. Do we have a another shortcut for user to return to 'Today'?

2. And I'm still a little confused, the value of the 'supportedControls' controls the display of those 6 options, what about the value of 'enable'? 

3. We think this is not a issue. Once we have more than 300 contacts and paging is involved, we can not find the specific location of the new edited contact, so we'll ignore this in UX2.3.

4. It seems that Matthieu had not updated the new messages about whitelist in time, because when user enabled 'Only allow mail from contacts', we will disable whitelist and blocksender-list and hide the options 'Whitelist sender' and 'Block sender' in the 'More' drop-down (In order to prevent users from operating whitelist and blocksender-list). But Matthieu seems disagree with this, so would you please add some comments on PERIDOT-11780 to explain this issue?
