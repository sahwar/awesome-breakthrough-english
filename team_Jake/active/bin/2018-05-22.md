Based on my test, I found that Chrome on SAMSUNG Android device did(does?) nothing when tapping "Print" button, but Safari on Iphone/Ipad worked(works?) well.

There seems no easy way for browsers on Android to support printing as brwosers on IOS. And now mobile printing need to by done either by saving as pdf/image files to print, or by installing a third-party browser tool to print. 


I tested again, but there are still some errors as the following steps:
1. Invoked "mail.message.print" to get printing HTML.
2. And then Invoked "noop" and "resource.upload" to save the HTML as a temp file.
3. At last, called "officePreview.getPdf" to download the converted PDF, but it threw an error.
