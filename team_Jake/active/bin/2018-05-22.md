Based on my test, I found that Chrome on SAMSUNG Android device did nothing when tapping "Print" button, and Safari on Iphone/Ipad worked well.

There is currently no single way to determine if browsers on Android support printing. And now mobile printing is done by saving as pdf/image files to print, or installing a third-party browser tool to print directly. 


I tested again, but there were still some errors as the following steps:
1. Invoked "mail.message.print" to get printing HTML.
2. And then Invoked "noop" and "resource.upload" to save printing HTML as a temp file.
3. Once again called "officePreview.getPdf" to download the converted PDF, but it threw a error as here.
