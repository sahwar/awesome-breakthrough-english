This is my plan for R&L in March. In order to get test result as soon as possible, I decide to run 3 cases first (Mail_Contact_Calendar_Task case, Mail_Category case and Mail_Attachment case), and then run Sort_Subject case if we have time. Meanwhile I think, on average the running time of each round can last more than one day, because the risk of crashing rises as the number of concurrents increased. And it can be uncertain in differnt rounds of running the same case. I'll raise flag and keey the schedule updated once it's been impacted by any risk.
