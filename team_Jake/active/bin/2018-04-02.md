This is my plan for R&L in March. In order to get test result as fast as possible, I decide to run 3 case first (Mail_Contact_Calendar_Task case, Mail_Category case and Mail_Attachment case), and run Sort_Subject case on spare time if we have. Meanwhile I think the running time of each round needs to be extended to one day on average, because the risk of case crash rises as the number of concurrents increases, and it's uncertain for case running between the first round and the other round. Of course, exact plan need to be adjusted when we run these cases.
