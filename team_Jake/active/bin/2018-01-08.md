Hi Deirdre,

Could you please add "Remove Cloud Association" step as the first step of "Set up Cloud Association" in order to explain that account cann't set up multiply cloud associations?
And could you please move cloud pages to "Ux Suite Online Help\Settings\cloud" folder? It looks more convenient for user to get cloud help by folder path.

Thanks


Hi Deirdreï¼Œ

Thank for your reply. There is no "Remove Preview Cloud Association" section, and I just feel it's better to give user some hint: when account have set a cloud association, user need to remove it and then set another one.

If you don't think it's necessary, I'm absolutely fine with that.

Thanks
Bin.
