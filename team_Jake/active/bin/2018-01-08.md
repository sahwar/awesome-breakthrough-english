Hi Deirdre,

Could you please add "Remove Cloud Association" step as the first step of "Set up Cloud Association", to explain that account cann't set up multiply cloud associations.
And could you please extract cloud pages under "Ux Suite Online Help\Settings\cloud" folder, it's convenient for user to get cloud help by folder path.

Thanks


Hi Deirdreï¼Œ

Thank for your reply. There is no "Remove Preview Cloud Association" section, and I just feel better to give user some hint: when account have set cloud association, user need to remove it and then set another one.

If you don't think it's necessary, just let it be that.

Thanks
Bin.
