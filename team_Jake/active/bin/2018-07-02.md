Uploading a file via Postman is different from Chrome, Chrome uploads received string stream using Blob that is a unique way to browsers. Could you check it to see which parameters is lost when invoking "officePreview.getPdf" API to upload.

I updated client codes and tested again, and found that uploaded blob object could be downloaded well by "resource.download", but called "officePreview.getPdf" incorrectly.
If so, and uploading printing message to convert as PDF isn't feasible in client. Webtop needs to create a new API for saving a message as PDF.
