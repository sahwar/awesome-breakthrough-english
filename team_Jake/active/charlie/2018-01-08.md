@shreenivas_n,

There is(are) some fields not show （？）due to client config. And the label('s width) of these （？fields）could be twice as long as long as（rm long as ） the (wide of?)'Default event duration'( e.g. 'Automatically empty trash when logging out'). In such situations, how much width should be set?
