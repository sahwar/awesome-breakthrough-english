Hi Rohit,

I thought it would be better if webtop throw an error like safe sender, and UI will pop up the message.
Also, I found other two problems:

If there was a contact had one email address, and user added the email address to block sender list, should we remove the contact?

If there was a contact has multiple email addresses, and user added one of these email addresses to block sender list, should we remove the contact or remove the added address?


Hi Rohit,

When user opens safe senders page for the first time, UI will call "mail.allowedSender.load()" api, and save the response to client as whiteListStore. If user tried to add an email address, UI would check whether the email address is already existed in whiteListStore or not. If yes, it would popup the following message. It doesn't need to call any webtop api.

So I need the response of "mail.allowedSender.load()" to be correct.
