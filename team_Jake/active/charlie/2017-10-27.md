The automation test cases for whitelist need to be checked again after backend support it.

I thought there was a script could create a file for the attachment view case, but I didn't find it. Do we have such a automatic script to create some files related to the attachment test case? And about the other special(what is special accounts?) accounts?

The commit should have/include the number for the repaired cases, and the class name(s) for each case.

It is possible to annotate the test step in detail, and each verify step should be annotated. These annotations also have other uses(use, what is other use?) later.
