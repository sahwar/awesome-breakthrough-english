Hi Shreenivas,

There is a ticket about calendar month popup (https://jira.synchronoss.net:8443/jira/browse/PERIDOT-12880). The popup should show repeat info, but I can not find it in the design, I have added the repeat info like event_repeat.png. About it, do you agree or have any advice?

This issue can reproduced in Draft folder on CPMS only. How about changing Priority to p4?

This issue can reproduced on samsung galaxy S6, can not reproduced on Galaxy S8, and the latest version is galaxy S9. How about changing Priority to p4?

If the reminder time is an integral multiple of days or hours, display the time by days or hours, or else display by minutes.
