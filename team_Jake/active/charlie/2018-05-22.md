Hi Shreenivas,

There is a ticket about calendar month popup (https://jira.synchronoss.net:8443/jira/browse/PERIDOT-12880). The popup should show repeat info, but I can not find it in the design, I have attached the repeat info screen event_repeat.png. do you agree the design or you have any other advice?

Considering this issue can only be reproduced in Draft folder of CPMS, can we change the Priority to p4?

This issue can be reproduced on samsung galaxy S6, but not on Galaxy S8, and I think the latest version is already galaxy S9. Can we lower the priority to p4?

(If the reminder time is an integral multiple of days or hours, display the time by days or hours, or else display by minutes.)
