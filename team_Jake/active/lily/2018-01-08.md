I checked Otasan code that Otosan customized settings ignores the message format configuration.

So, it's impossible for user to set it in settings.

But It's doable to select a editor type in compose.

Set WebtopConfig.mail.enableOptionsBar to true and WebtopConfig.mail.editorType to 'both', the editor select field would display in compose page.

The two configurations are in custom-config.js.
