Hi Shaun,

I'm working on PERIDOT-13020 (add an advertising service profile based on user CoS) and PERIDOT-13022 (add the ability to return a login alias to the client).

I saw you had resolved the related tickets MERCURY-1281 and MERCURY-1282.

I have some questions about them.

For MERCURY-1281, I didn't find  ``` 
<advertising enabled="true" allowList="false"></advertising>  ``` section in 'getCurrentUserInfo' response in the latest build (Methane 2.2.57.0 and Octane 1.3.71.0).

Do you know which release the service will be ready?

And I'm not sure what Cos is, could you please tell me if you know what it means?

For MERCURY-1282, there are comment (*This will add an optional 'sessionName' field to the user profile which is returned if the session user differs from the user id. All clients will be able to use this to detect alias logins independently from the way the user logged in.*) on the ticket.

'user profile' here means 'user' section in ‘getCurrentUserInfo’ response?

'sessionName' field is a string or an object?

How does ‘sessionName' associate with the login alias?
