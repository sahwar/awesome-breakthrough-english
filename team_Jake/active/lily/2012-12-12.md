The client is hard to give a full estimate now for the following reason.
- The design for TUI is not ready (only partial mail APP design)
- There are very big changes on the below three features in RUI. Considering the high risk and effort, I suggest not to implement them in UX2.3MR1 (see design picture at the end).
  - attachment preview (It's hard to make our client behave like office365 when user take actions like reply, delete and move, etc. on the message in the right panel.)
  - mail search dropped down panel (It seems going to need both client and server works)
  - showing group in contact list (high risk and effort)
- It's medium risk and effort to implement the following features. I'm not sure if they are valuable enough for UX2.3MR1.
  - selected contact search panel
  - contact alphabetic search
