The client is hard to give a full estimate now for the following reason.
- The design for TUI is not ready (only partial mail APP design)
- There are very big changes on the below three features in RUI. Considering the high risk and effort, I suggest not to implement them in UX2.3MR1 (see design picture in the end).
  - attachment preview (the client is hard to do a UI response like what office365 do when user operates (reply, delete, move, etc.) on the message in the right panel.)
  - mail search dropped down panel (It seems not possible for only the client to do that)
  - showing group in contact list (high risk and effort)
- It has medium risk and effort to implement the following features. I'm not sure if they are enough important and valuable to do in UX2.3MR1.
  - selected contact search panel
  - contact alphabetic search
