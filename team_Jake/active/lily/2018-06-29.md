Hi Max,

Confirm with Thunder, currently WebTop doesn't pass 'X-CP-GRMDR' property to backend.

That means it doesn't work although the client set 'X-CP-GRMDR:true' on a task.

However, the client code supports PS to add a new property.

From my point of view there are two solutions to add 'X-CP-GRMDR' property in the client.

1. Update 'TaskModel' to make 'xproperty' field to be an associated 'hasMany' field. But I don't suggest to use the way in customization project because it needs to override too many related files.

2. Using Common.data.Webtop.request to save or edit task. You can override 'addTask' and 'editTask' method in 'Richui.controller.task.TaskController' class.

Here is an example of rewriting ‘addTask’ method.
