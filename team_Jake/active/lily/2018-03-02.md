Itâ€™s ok for resizing right ADV.

But for bottom left ADV, it may be unsuitable to resize with browser size.

The width of bottom left ADV is the(X) same with(comparing? use same as) the folder panel.

If we change the ADV size, the folder panel would also be affected and message list followed.

In the eyes of the user(In customer vision), the page may be a little flicker.

I checked office365 and Gmail and(x +,) found(X) neither folder panel size changes()changed when(while) resizing.

Unlike the right panel with a fixed width, the left panel width is changeable (really changeable means you can't predict ).

User can drag the splitter next to folder panel to manually change it.(user can manually change it by draging the splitter nex to folder panel)

For the above reasons(for all the reasons above), I suggest not to include bottom left ADV in the task.
