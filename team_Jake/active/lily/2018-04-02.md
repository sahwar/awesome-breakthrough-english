Hi Shreenivas,

I'm implementing TUI design for UX2.3 MR1. 

I found font and icon are too big for phone.

For example: 

In compose page:

In original page, the font size of 'Cancel', 'Compose' and 'Send' are 18px and the font size of 'To', 'Subject' and 'Attach' are 12px.

In new design, their font size is 35px and 30px.

After I set font size to 35px , some items overlapped because of no enough space on phone.

Could you please update TUI design with a small font and icon?
