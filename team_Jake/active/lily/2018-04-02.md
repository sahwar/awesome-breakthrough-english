Hi Shreenivas,

I'm implementing TUI design for UX2.3 MR1. 

I found (the)font and icon are too big for （on） phone.

For example: 

In compose page:

In original page, the font size of 'Cancel', 'Compose' and 'Send' (is)are 18px(.) and(X) (The)the font size of 'To', 'Subject' and 'Attach'(is) are 12px.

In new design, their font size is(are) 35px and 30px.

After I set font size to 35px , some items overlapped because of(X) no enough(limited) space on phone.

-------Because of is  generally followed by a verb+ing or a noun. 
--------Because is followed by a subject and a verb.

Could you please update TUI design with a(X) small(smaller) font and icon?
