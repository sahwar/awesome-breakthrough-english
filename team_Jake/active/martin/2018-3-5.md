  Because of I am a new member, everything is new, I must get familiar with
the environment and take part in the team work as soon as possible. During
the five months since I joined, I have a big improvement in the knowledge 
of the product and its detail, thanks for the Jake and other team workersâ€™ help. 
Everything seems going well. Above all I think my first achievement is achieved.

I was new to the team and there were quite a lot to catch up. 
Thanks to Jake and other teammates' help, I got a big improvement in understanding the product and our work flows during the past five months. 
Thus, my first goal is achieved.
