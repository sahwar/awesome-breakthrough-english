There are several ways to change the PERIDOT lib component.

Overwrite the component:

Create the component used for replacing to lib, you should make the file path to be the same as the one in lib. However, it is not absolutely.
Customization your component. It will receive the props just like it works in PERIDOT/lib.
Change the “overwrite/index.js”. Add the resolve path of the component which you want to replace.
Done.
