Itâ€™s ok for resizing right ADV.

But for bottom left ADV, it may be unsuitable to resize with browser size.

The width of bottom left ADV is the same with the folder panel.

If we change the ADV size, the folder panel would also be affected and message list followed.

In the eyes of the user, the page may be a little flicker.

I checked office365 and Gmail and found neither folder panel size changes when resizing.

Unlike the right panel with a fixed width, the left panel width is changeable.

User can drag the splitter next to folder panel to manually change it.

For the above reasons, I suggest not to include bottom left ADV in the task.
